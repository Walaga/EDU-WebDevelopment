        <h1>Difference between AI,ML and DL</h1>
        <P>Artificial Intelligence(AI)-is a science that studies ways to build intelligent programs and machines that can creatively solve problems, which has always been considered a human prerogative.</P>
        <p>Machine Learning(ML)-is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.</p>
        <p>Deep Learning(DL)-is a subset of machine learning, which uses the neural networks to analyze different factors with a structure that is similar to the human neural system.</p>
